**Wrastor**:  
Tornado goes less high  
Dspecial is a quick, in place burst, high endlag, hard punishes on read, little on reaction  
Fspecial does not knock up (Once hitstun modifier is in place, BKB will be lowered as well)  
Slight buff to double jump height  
Roll/dodges/parry are 0.0.8 vanilla
